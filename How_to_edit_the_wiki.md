# What is a Lab Wiki?
- A digital space to organize lab knowledge.
- Think of it as a lab manual, FAQ, and resource hub.
- Accessible via the web.

# How to contribute?
- Lab wikis are edited and maintained by group members.
- Sessions when everyone get together to collaborate on the wiki are commonly called hackathons.

# How it works
- The main language of the wiki documentation is Markdown. Here are some nice resources you can use:
  -  [Markdown cheat sheet](https://quickref.me/markdown)
  -  [Getting started with Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- This wiki is stored in a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository, where each section of the wiki corresponds to a single Markdown file (*.md). By editing these files either online or locally, the wiki can be updated by everyone.

# Instructions:

## Using the task organizer in the Projects section
- A tool to manage and track tasks (issues) directly inside GitHub.
- Tasks move through columns, e.g.: "To do" → "In progress" → "Done".
- Helps organize work within a group of contributors

**4.** Create a branch and work on it. Check the preview to be sure that your page looks nice.
